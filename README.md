# KittyBot

Discord Bot written entirely in the C++ programming language!

So far, this project is only a proof of concept.

## Setup
To run this bot yourself, you will need to create a .env file in the project root.

It must look something like this;
```env
KITTY_TOKEN=mycooltokenhere
```
And the project should look like this.
```bash
KittyBot
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── KittyBot
│   └── ...
├── .env
└── ...
```
